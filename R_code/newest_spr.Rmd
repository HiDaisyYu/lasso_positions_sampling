This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(lme4)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotrix)
library(visreg)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(gridExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(vip) 
library(plm)
```


```{r}
new_format_spr_data<- read_csv("/Users/noa/Workspace/lasso_positions_sampling_results/new_spr_lasso.csv")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
