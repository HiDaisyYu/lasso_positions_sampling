IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Q9BW27_HUMAN and Q8NDI4_HUMAN are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Q9CYI9_MOUSE and Q8R480_MOUSE are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Q8RXH2_ARATH and Q9ASW9_ARATH are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 3 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file /groups/itay_mayrose/danaazouri/powerLawProject/data/PANDIT/PF07575/ref_msa.aa.phy.reduced
